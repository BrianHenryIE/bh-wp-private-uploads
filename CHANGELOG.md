## Unreleased

### Fixed

* The `API` class no longer requires the `upload_files` capability, so uploads succeed on cron and WP-CLI (where there is no logged-in user). Authorization remains enforced at each request boundary. Consumer plugins can veto uploads via the new `bh_wp_private_uploads_{post_type}_can_upload` filter.
